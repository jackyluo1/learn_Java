/**
 * Problem 2 [40pts]
 * Create a class Employee that includes the following instance variables
 * • First name (String) cannot be empty,
 * • Last name (String) cannot be empty,
 * • Monthly salary (double) must be non-negative.
 * Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. The setters must return boolean
 * and perform validation. If the monthly salary is not positive, set its value to zero. If a name is
 * empty set it to “[empty]”. 
 * Provide a constructor that initializes the three instance variables.
 * No default constructor is required. Also, overwrite equals() and toString(). Write a
 * test class named EmployeeTest that demonstrates class Employee’s capabilities. Create two
 * different Employee objects. Use println() to display information about each employee (this
 * will invoke toString()). Then compare the two using equals() and display the result.
 * Submission format: You MUST define TWO classes. One is Employee which must be declared
 * as a non-public class. Two is EmployeeTest which is public and contains the main()
 * method. So, you must submit one file EmployeeTest.java containing the above two classes.
 * The tests must be performed in the main() method.
